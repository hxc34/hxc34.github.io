# hxc34.github.io
Development process: 
1. Came up with template that site would follow; Ended up choosing a symmetrical top to bottom template
2. Checked my existing libaries for any assets I could reuse
3. Placed down all the html5 content and text first
4. Played around with CSS to get website looking clean.
5. Implemented links, buttons, downloads, and fiddled with image size
6. Published the website.
